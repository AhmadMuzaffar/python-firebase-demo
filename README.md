# python-firebase-demo
A demo of how to use Python with firebase

The script watch_firebase.py will watch for changes to Firebase and print the changed nodes to console.

The script get_input.py will get key, value pairs from the terminal and add to Firebase.

Run the watch_firebase.py script in a terminal, run the get_input.py in another terminal. Any new key, value pairs added via the get_input.py script will be seen instantly in the other terminal
